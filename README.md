The VM is based on a simplified version of RISC-V for simplicity. It should be
fairly simple to lower the instructions into real assembly.

The goal of this project is to compile programs into bytecodes for a lower-level
virtual machine, which can be interpreted, or eventually lowered into actual machine code.
